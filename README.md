# SemanticFramework

*SemanticFramework* is a simple .CSS framework for creating web applications quickly. It takes inspiration from the cut-down nature of Skeleton, and ties it in with the flexiability of the Bootstrap.

## Using Semantic

To use the semantic framework, simply download a copy of the .css file and include it into your HTML page.
